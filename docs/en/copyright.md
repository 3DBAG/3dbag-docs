The 3D BAG is open data. This includes all downloadable data files and data distributed through web services. You are free to copy, distribute, and adapt the 3D BAG data, as long as you,

1. give credit to the 3D geoinformation group and 3DGI,
2. provide a link to this license,
3. indicate if you made any changes to the data.

*Note that some content in the documentation is reused from other works. Such content has its source marked explicitly, and you need to comply with their respective license when using them.*

### How to credit the 3D BAG

We require that you use the credit “© 3D BAG by tudelft3d and 3DGI”. 

In digital media you must also provide a link to [this copyright page](https://docs.3dbag.nl/en/copyright). In printed media, or where links are not possible, its best if you expand the credit to "3D BAG by 3D geoinformation research group (TU Delft) and 3DGI" and direct the readers to "3dbag.nl".

The name *tudelft3d* is a short alias to the full name *3D geoinformation research group*.

If you integrate the 3D BAG data in a browsable electronic map, the credit should appear in the bottom right corner of the map.
