[IFC (Industry Foundation Classes)](https://technical.buildingsmart.org/standards/ifc/) is a global, open standard for sharing building and facility data. It is an open standard and widely used for Building Information Modeling (BIM) during the design and construction phases.

Since 3DBAG version 2025.09.03 we offer an experimental IFC version of the 3DBAG data. This is IFC version 4.3 provided in the IFC STEP-file format (ISO 10303-21) with the `.ifc` extension.
