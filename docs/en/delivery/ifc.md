[IFC (Industry Foundation Classes)](https://technical.buildingsmart.org/standards/ifc/) is a global, open standard for sharing building and facility data. It is non-proprietary and widely used for Building Information Modeling (BIM). 

In this 3DBAG release (2025.09.03) we make available an experimental IFC version of the 3DBAG data (version: IFC4.3). The data is provided in IFC STEP-file format (ISO 10303-21) with the `.ifc` extension.
