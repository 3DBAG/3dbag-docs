## Unreleased (First full release)
These are the issues that we want to solve for the first full release of the 3D BAG.

## 21.03.1 (2021.03.26) â€“ beta

#### Added

+ A brand new 3D viewer.
+ Multiple LoDs, LoD1.2, LoD1.3, LoD2.2.
+ 2D and 3D variants of all LoDs. The 3D models are triangulated.
+ More accurate height calculation, due to our new reconstruction method.
+ Underground buildings and floating buildings are removed, underground parts are cut off from the models. This means that we modify the incoming BAG footprints by removing the underground parts.
+ Integrated validation of the 3D models with val3dity.
+ OBJ and CityJSON data formats.
+ A completely re-worked documentation.
+ Report issues on individual buildings and provide general feedback with a form.

#### Changed

+ Downloads are available in tiles instead of the whole country. Except the PostgreSQL backup, which is only available for the whole country.
+ Switched to BAG 2.0.
+ Basically all the attributes have changed. Note that due to our new reconstruction method, the meaning of the building height percentiles `h_dak` have changed too. Previously we had multiple percentiles for the ground height, while there is only one `h_maaiveld` now.
+ All the URLs.
+ New contact information.

#### Removed

+ CSV data format.

#### Known issues

+ Some buildings have a 'spike': a large deviation in the building geometry due to one vertex with an erroneous coordinate (3D models only).
+ Not all buildings are geometrically valid (eg. missing face). Note that this should be evident from the val3dity_codes attribute (3D models only).
+ Missing tiles: 42, 2178, 10, 3647, 309, 1389, 20, 736, 6, 8, 52, 50, 53, 57, 51.
