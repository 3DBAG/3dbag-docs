And with the Viewer you can view the 3D BAG in your browser! What is the 3D BAG? \u00b6 The 3D BAG is an up-to-date register of 3D building models of the Netherlands. The 3D BAG is open data. It contains 3D models in multiple levels of details, which are generated by combining two open data sets, the building data from the BAG and the height data from the AHN . The 3D BAG is updated regularly, keeping it up-to-date with the latest openly available building stock and elevation information. The 3D BAG is also a place for experiments. It is a medium for testing our ideas at the 3D geoinformation research group. We are constantly improving our methods, and by providing our own service we retain full control over the whole process. This allows us to test and release the improvements, or even break things, as we see best. Main features \u00b6 Three levels of detail . Pick the most suitable LoD for your application from the available LoD1.2, LoD1.3 and LoD2.2. Both 2D and 3D . Besides the 3D models, we also offer the 2D projections of their roof surfaces. Underground and overlapping buildings and parts removed . The completely underground and overlapping buildings (eg one building \"floating\" above another) are excluded from the reconstruction. Buildings with parts under the terrain have their underground parts cut off. Fall back to a simple model for problematic input . Buildings with glass roofs, especially greenhouses, have an extremely noisy point cloud in the AHN. For these buildings, that usually have a very simple shape, we fall back to a simplified 3D model in order generate usable models. Quality control integrated . We run our 3D models through val3dity , so that you don't need to. Available in several formats . Such as CityJSON, GeoPackage, Wavefront OBJ, PostgreSQL, WMS, WFS. Common applications \u00b6 Some of the use cases for this data set that we know about: Applications related to energy use in buildings, such as estimating energy demand, retrofitting costs, finding suitable roofs for solar panels etc. Simulating the wind flow and pollutant dispersion in urban areas. Calculating noise pollution in urban areas (eg. ) Analysing the urban structure and evaluating new developments. Do you have an interesting use case for the 3D BAG? We would love to hear about it! Relation to similar data sets \u00b6 3D Basisvoorziening \u00b6 The 3D Basisvoorziening is a collection of Dutch national 3D data sets were created in a collaboration of the Kadaster and the 3D geoinformation research group. It was made available in the summer of 2020. While the 3D BAG only contains objects from the BAG, the 3D Basisvoorziening also contains object from the Large Scale Topographic Map (BGT) of the Netherlands. Thus, the 3D BAG only contains buildings, while the 3D Basisvoorziening is a watertight 3D model of the whole country. Furthermore, the 3D BAG only uses the AHN as height source, while the 3D Basisvoorziening also uses a yearly updated point cloud created from stereo images ( Beeldmateriaal Nederland ). However, neither the high resolution Beeldmateriaal Nederland , nor the point cloud created from it is open data. The buildings from the BAG are used in the 3D Basisvoorziening since the height information is acquired from the air, and the footprints of the BAG are based on the top perspective of the building. Therefore they can be reconstructed more accurately than BGT footprints, because these are based on the ground level. The footprints from the BAG however do not perfectly connect with the BGT, and therefore pre-processing on the 2D data needs to be done to yield a watertight 3D model in the end. The tools and algorithms that are used for generating the 3D Basisvoorziening, are created by the 3D geoinformation group. In fact, the LoD1.3 models in the 3D Basisvoorziening were generated with an older, more stable version of the same algorithms that we use in the 3D BAG. 3D Geluid \u00b6 The 3D Geluid data set was created in collaboration with the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management (Rijkswaterstaat), Interprovinciaal Overleg, Kadaster and the 3D geoinformation research group. Both the 3D Geluid and the 3D BAG use the BAG as a basis for the buildings. While the 3D BAG uses the AHN only, the 3D Geluid data has been extended with LoD1.2 models that were generated with the current point cloud of Kadaster where the buildings are newer than the AHN. Besides building models, the 3D Geluid data also contains two additional layers that model the terrain, and the sound absorption values of the various objects. The building models in 3D Geluid data are LoD1.3 2D only, since the currently common noise calculation software can only handle 2D buildings (+ height attribute). Similarly to the 3D Basisvoorziening, the LoD1.3 models in the 3D Geluid data were generated with an older, more stable version of the same algorithms that we use in the 3D BAG. Issues that we know about \u00b6 One of the most common questions related to building heights is the exact number of floors in the building. However, answering this proves to be more complex than dividing the building height by an average floor height (eg 3 meters). Thus, we have an ongoing MSc research that is investigating this topic. Addresses. At the moment we don't add the addresses from the BAG to the 3D BAG. We might add them in the future. Funding \u00b6 This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unions Horizon2020 Research & Innovation Programme (grant agreement no. 677312 UMnD: Urban modelling in higher dimensions).","title":"Summary"},{"location":"#general-summary","text":"Welcome to the documentation of the 3D BAG by the 3D geoinformation group!

The better the input, the better the 3D BAG. Several of our choices were governed by the characteristics of these input data sets, therefore in order to better understand the 3D BAG, it is important to take a look at the data sources first. BAG \u00b6 The Register of Buildings and Addresses (BAG) is the most detailed, openly available data set on buildings and addresses in the Netherlands. It contains information about each address in a building, such as its current use, construction date or registration status. The data set is regularly updated as new buildings are registered, built or demolished. The municipalities are responsible for the acquisition, maintenance and quality assurance of the data within their boundaries. The data from each municipality is centralised and published by Kadaster. The BAG contains serveral types of objects, for the 3D BAG only the buildings are used. The polygons in the BAG represent the footprint of the building as the projection of the roof\u2019s outline. While in comparison, the BGT registers the outline of the building as it touches the terrain. An overview of the attributes of the BAG can be found in the BAG manual . AHN \u00b6 The National Height Model of the Netherlands (AHN) is the openly available elevation data set of the Netherlands. This is acquired through airborn laser scranning (LiDAR), with an average point density of 8 points per square meter. For the 3D BAG we currently use the third version, AHN3. This version was collected in stages, between 2014 and 2019. Here you can find the collection dates for each region in the Netherlands. One of the main arguments against the AHN in general that is deemed to be out dated by design, due to long mission times for acquiring the scans. However, the building stock changes in a relatively slow pace, this pace being faster in metropolitan regions and even slower in remote areas of the country. Unfortunately, timestamps are not provided with the point data in the AHN3, but we can only compare the acquisition years for a region to the construction years of the buildings. From this we estimate that about 95% of the measured building heights are still valid. Additionally, there is a variation in the point density between buildings. There can be gaps in the points, caused by an occlusion through objects or water ponds. The number of available points, their distribution and accurate classification has a very significant impact on the quality of the reconstructed models. AHN4? \u00b6 At the moment of writing the new AHN4 will soon become available for a part of the country. While the AHN3 was acquired in 5 years, the AHN4 must be done in 3 years. The new AHN will have a different, improved quality, compared to the AHN3, and we expect that this will have a visible impact on the 3D BAG as well. As soon as the first region is available, we will integrate it into our process. BGT \u00b6 The Large Scale Topographic Map of the Netherlands contains many object types besides buildings, such as roads, water ways, railways, and it forms a complete coverage of the country. The responsible source providers are the provinces, municipalities and water boards, each in their own administration. For the 3D BAG, the BGT is used for detecting the buildings that overlap with other objects, such as roads and other buildings. Such overlapping buildings are marked and excluded from the reconstruction process. TOP10NL \u00b6 The TOP10NL is part of the TOPNL data sets , which belong to the Topographic Register of the Netherlands. These are topographic maps at various scales, ranging from 1:10,000 to 1:1,500,000. They can be used as data source, as well as base maps in visualisations. From the TOP10NL we only use the buildings, in order to identify the greenhouses and large warehouses among the BAG objects. Due to their glass roof, greehouses are problematic for our reconstruction algorithm, therefore we only model them with a simplified shape.","title":"Data Sources"},{"location":"overview/sources/#data-sources","text":"The quality and characteristics of the 3D BAG depend on the source data that we use.

The BAG models buildings with their largest extent as viewed from above. In practice this means a single 2D polygon per building, as it is displayed by the black polygon in the figure. Therefore, the BAG polygon also includes parts of the building that are below terrain level. In order to create an accurate model of the above terrain parts of a building, we cut off the below terrain parts from the BAG polygon. We only consider the parts above the terrain, because we do not have data on the 3D extent of the parts below the terrain. From the parts above terrain we then generate the 3D models in LoD1.2, 1.3 and 2.2. We realise that for some applications it is more suitable to read 2D polygons, and the building height information from attributes. Therefore, we also provide a 2D counterpart in each LoD. lod11_replace In case of greenhouses and large warehouses we do not cut off any parts of the BAG model, but take the polygon as is, and only generate an LoD1.1 model. Thus, such buildings only have an LoD1.1 model and are marked with the attribute value lod11_replace = true . In case of the 2D models, the polygons represent the 2D projection of the roof planes of the 3D model. For LoD1.2 and LoD1.3 the 3D model can be fully reconstructed from the 2D model, by taking the 2D polygons and extruding each to one of their h_dak_* height values. However, this is not true for the LoD2.2 models, since here we have slanted roof planes, which cannot be represented by a 2D polygon and a single height value. The 3D BAG has 6 geometric representations of a BAG object (a feature ). The 6 representations are the 2D and 3D variants of the LoD1.2, LoD1.3 and LoD2.2 models of the feature. Therefore, the BAG models, which are stored on the pand layer, have a feature ID ( fid ), while their geometric representations have geometry IDs ( gid ). Depending on the representation, a single feature can have multiple geometry parts. Some buildings have multiple disjoint part above the terrain, while they are connected with an underground garage for instance.
